# adamh.cz

Source code of my personal website [adamh.cz](https://www.adamh.cz).
I've used some great open source projects which was the main reason to make its
source public.

## Usage

Just run

    make serve

and head to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the site in action.

## Based on

 * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - the static site generator
 * [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - butler for Jekyll. Great thing to start with!
 * [Publish](https://kovshenin.com/themes/publish/) - Clean and mininal theme
   originally for Wordpress. I'm using its CSS and layout
 * [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) - The iconic font
   and CSS toolkit
 * [Share buttons widget](http://codingtips.kanishkkunal.in/share-buttons-jekyll/)
