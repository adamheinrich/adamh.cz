A few days ago I discovered very nice acrylic enclosure for my BeagleBone board at <a href="http://builttospecstore.storenvy.com/products/225603-beaglebone-enclosure">Built-to-Spec</a>. Craig placed his project to <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15583">Thingiverse</a>, so that everyone can make his own. I have sent these design files to one of local laser etching services (<a href="http://alexk.cz">alexk.cz</a> from Opava, Czech Republic if someone is interested).

The case looks <strong>really good</strong>! Since I have the new A6 revision of BeagleBone board, I had to make hole for its SD card slot a little big larger using my knife. Craig from Built to Spec has already created <a href="http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2012/03/01/beaglebone-case-update-and-new-kits-page/">modified version</a> which solves this issue.

Both sites <em>Built-to-Spec</em> and <em>Thingiverse</em> are worth seeing since they offer more interesting projects. I am happy that so many people publish their constructions on the web. They all help to make our world better place :-)
