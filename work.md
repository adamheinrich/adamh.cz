  Buildroot, U-Boot)
- [nanomidi](https://github.com/adamheinrich/nanomidi) -- Stream-based encoder
  and decoder for MIDI messages in C
- [cm-makefile](https://github.com/adamheinrich/cm-makefile) -- Makefile
  template for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller projects
- [Ego-motion Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on a Single-Board Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07278) --
  Odometry sensor based on a ground-facing camera and Raspberry Pi’s hardware
  video encoder
- [Old projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/old-projects) -- Mostly small robots and

**Work for clients**

- Dual-bank bootloader with consistency checking for fail-safe firmware upgrades
  (STM32)
- Design and development of multi-role communication over Bluetooth Low Energy
  in a wireless sensor (BLE, nRF51/52, Nordic SDK)
- Complete design and development of “IoT” devices (PCB design in KiCad,
  prototype assembly, CM assembly, firmware development)
- Development of assembly line tests and on-site debugging in close
  cooperation with the manufacturer
